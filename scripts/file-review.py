"""File a reviewer's answers that came back by hand.

The review form can post itself to the server, and it can also hand the reviewer their answers
as JSON to send back over LINE or email — which is what happens while `/api/review` does not
exist yet, and what will keep happening whenever a reviewer is somewhere the server is not.

Both paths must land in the same place under the same key, or the same review filed twice by two
routes becomes two records. The key here is derived exactly as `review.rs` derives it: seconds,
then six bytes of a SHA-256 over the content.

Re-filing the same answers replaces one record rather than adding a second — and, like
`Submission::file` in `review.rs`, that is decided by reading what is already on disk and not by
the key alone. The key cannot do it on its own: file the same answers a minute later and the
timestamp half of the key has moved, so the write lands beside the first record instead of on it.
A match keeps the key and the `at` of the record already there.

    scripts/file-review.py mook.json                  # into ./state (the default disk store)
    scripts/file-review.py --root /data mook.json
    pbpaste | scripts/file-review.py -                # straight from the clipboard
    scripts/file-review.py --dry-run mook.json        # show what would be written

Firestore deployments are not written here on purpose: filing into a live production store from
a laptop is not something a helper script should make easy.
