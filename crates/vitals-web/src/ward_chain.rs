//! Reading the ward off the chain.
//!
//! Everything `/api/ward` publishes is derived here, and the rule the endpoint makes to its
//! readers is the rule this module has to keep: **no number the server keeps for itself.** The
//! patients come from patient accounts, the shifts from anchored leaves in transaction history,
//! and the keys from the signers of those leaves. Nothing increments a counter, so nothing can
//! drift — and when the chain cannot be read, the answer is [`crate::ward::ward_unavailable`] and
//! never a zero, because a zero looks exactly like a ward nobody came to.
//!
//! **Why history at all, when the patient account already counts her shifts.** It does, and the
//! count would be cheaper — but a count cannot say *who*. The one claim the ward makes about
//! strangers is that the record says which key did what, so the signers have to be read, and once
//! they are read the shifts may as well be counted from the same place rather than from a second
//! source that could disagree with it.
//!
//! History is walked once. Each patient's read stops at the newest signature already seen
//! ([`Seen::until`]), so a ward that has been open for a month costs the same per tick as one
//! opened this morning, and the cache lives wherever [`crate::store::Store`] lives — Firestore on
//! Cloud Run, where it survives the restarts a serverless host does without telling anyone.
